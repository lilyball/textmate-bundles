Hey!  One I actually wrote! :-)

Features the following:
• bare-bones command for running ant.
  I'm not too happy with the way TM handles the external command or the new
  window, so I mostly stick with Terminal.app for this one.
• snippet for creating getters and setters
  I'm pretty happy with this one. The order you do the placeholders is a
  little weird, but it does work...
• syntaxes for properties files and the Java language
• "Java Class" and "Java Interface" templates, which attempt to set the
  package and @author tag automagically

The templates now properly generate the package name based on the directory structure.  The templates assume that your .java files are in package structure in a directory named "src".  If this is not the case, add a shell variable named "org_bravo5_Java_pkgregexp"; the default value is a regexp (^.*src/) passed to sed that operates on the TM_NEW_FILE_DIRECTORY variable.
