# Help for the SQL Bundle

## Execute Line / Selection as SQL Query

The _Execute Line / Selection as SQL Query_ command takes the selected text or current line and submits it as a query to either MySQL or PostgreSQL.

You can set `TM_DB_SERVER` to either `mysql` or `postgresql` to select the database software to use. If this variable is unset, the command will check to see if there is either a `mysql` or `psql8` shell command in your path, if only there is one of these, this one will be used, otherwise a dialog will ask you about which database software should be used for the query.

### MySQL

When submitting the query to MySQL, the command assumes the following environment variables are properly set:

* `$MYSQL_USER` — defaults to the value of `$USER`
* `$MYSQL_PWD ` — no default
* `$MYSQL_HOST` — defaults to localhost if not set
* `$MYSQL_PORT` — defaults to 3306 if not set
* `$MYSQL_DB  ` — no default

These variables may be set in the parent shell of TextMate, global variables in TextMate preferences, or as project local variables.

### PostgreSQL

If you are a Postgres user and have the `psql8` command installed (as from [DarwinPorts](http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/) for example) the following variables will be used:

* `$PGUSER` — defaults to the value of `$USER`
* `$PGHOST` — defaults to localhost if not set
* `$PGPORT` — defaults to 3306 if not set
* `$PGDATABASE` — defaults to user

PostgreSQL users should also note that there is not a command line argument to provide your password.  To use PostgreSQL on a database with a password from TextMate you should set up a `~/.pgpass` file.  This file should contain lines of the following format:

	hostname:port:database:username:password

## Table Browser

The table browser command displays a list of tables in whatever database you are currently working in using either PostgreSQL or MySQL.  Which one is determined like with the _Execute Line / Selection as SQL Query_ command.

The current database is specified by either `PGDATABASE`, or `MYSQL_DB`.  If neither is set the table browser will default to using your username.  For MySQL to work you must have the `MYSQL_PWD` environment variable set.  For PostgreSQL you must have an entry in your `.pgpass` file.
