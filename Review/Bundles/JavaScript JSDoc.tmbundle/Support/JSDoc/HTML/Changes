2.9 Mon Jan 29 15:54:03 EST 2007
   - New Feature: the new force_untaint option makes sure you do not
     pass tainted values to param(). [Sven Neuhaus]

   - New Feature: Added ESCAPE=NONE as a synonym for ESCAPE=0.  Fixed 
     both to work with default_escape. [cpan@punch.net]

   - Bug Fix: DEFAULT didn't work with URL and JS escaping. 

   - Bug Fix: Long-standing bug where variables set in a loop weren't
     available inside inner loops under global_vars if the variable
     wasn't actually used in the outer loop.  (Thanks to Richard Fein
     for help debugging the fix.)

   - Doc Fix: Changed references to CVS in the docs to Subversion now that
     the switch is complete.

   - Test Fix: At long last, the work from the Phalanx project has
     been merged!  The tests are now more complete and easier to work
     on.  Thanks Phalanx guys!

2.8 Wed Dec 21 18:37:39 EST 2005
   - New Feature: the new default_escape option allows you to apply
     escaping to all variables in a template. [Alex Kapranoff]

   - Bug Fix: ESCAPE wasn't working on variables containing code-refs.

   - Bug Fix: Changed HTML::Template to help sub-classes by called
     _new_from_loop() via ref($self) rather than hard-coding the package
     name. [Mark Stosberg]

   - Bug Fix: Including more than one <tmpl_else> tag in <tmpl_unless> or
     <tmpl_unless> now dies with an error message, instead of silently ignoring
     one of the clauses. [Mitar and Mark Stosberg]

   - Bug Fix: Fixed HTML::Template to re-evaluate conditions to handle
     <tmpl_else>.  This bug could cause HTML::Template to take both
     branches of a conditional if a code-ref parameter returned a
     different value when called a second time. [Emanuele Zeppieri]


2.7 Thu Jun 24 12:00:00 2004
   - New Feature: Added javascript escaping with ESCAPE=JS. (Craig Manley)

   - Bug Fix: Improved cache keying to be sensitive to options which
              alter the compilation of templates (path, search_path,
              loop_context_vars and global_vars).  Calls to new() with
              different settings for any of these options will no longer pull
              incorrect cached objects.

   - Bug Fix: Added code to detect broken Perl 5.8.0 installs
              during installation (i.e. Redhat 8 and 9).

   - Bug Fix: Fixed parsing of ESCAPE='URL' (Paul Baker)

   - Bug Fix: Added check for empty filename passed to new().

   - Test Fix: Migrated tests to Test::More.  This will allow the
               easier introduction of new tests and the use of
               Devel::Cover. (Gabor Szabo)

2.6 Thu Aug 29 12:00:00 2002
   - New Feature: HTML::Template will combine HTML_TEMPLATE_ROOT
                  environment variable and path option if both are

   - New Feature: __counter__ variable now available when
                  loop_context_vars is set (Simran Gambhir)
   - New Feature: The default attribute allows you to specify
                  defaults for <tmpl_var> tags.
   - Bug Fix: fixed parser to reject <tmpl_var>s with no names.
              (crazyinsomniac)

              interaction of case_sensitive and loop_context_vars.
